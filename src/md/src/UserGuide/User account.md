User account
------------

To navigate to the user profile page, click the username drop-down in the right
header and select "Profile" option.

The user Profile page consists of the following elements:

- Personal information and photo – JPEG, PNG, GIF file, no more than 1 MB and 300x500px.

- "UUID" – a unique user identifier. UUID is used in automated test
configuration files for a user authentication instead of a password. It will
allow you to post data, but not log in UI.

- "Regenerate UUID" button – the button that allows generating a new UUID. If a
new UUID is generated, you have to update the automated test configuration file.

- "Projects and roles" – the list of your projects and the specified roles. This
is a read-only list. The current project is highlighted.
